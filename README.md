Request a job as shown in the attached image (just click submit when you pull up the same left hand settings). After a small wait time, a new screen will show up and you will click connect.  Sometimes there are not enough nodes initially and you have to wait a bit longer. After you connect, you should be in your work directory, which will allow you to navigate to LRS2Multi/notebooks.  There will be a file called example_reduction.ipynb.  Open that notebook and follow the instructions to get started.
